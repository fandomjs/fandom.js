# Request Manager

Coordinates HTTP requests to the Fandom API, handling retries, backoff, and normalization.

## Configuration

```ts
const client = new Client({
  site: 'example.fandom.com',
  request: {
    retries: 3,
    retryDelayMs: 500,
    timeoutMs: 15000,
  },
});
```

## Errors

All API errors surface as typed `ApiError`. See ./errors.

## Advanced

- Custom headers
- Per-request overrides
- Abort signals for timeouts/cancellation
