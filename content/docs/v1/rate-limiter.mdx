# Rate Limiter

Ensures safe concurrency across all managers using token buckets and queues.

## Configuration

```ts
const client = new Client({
  site: 'example.fandom.com',
  rateLimiter: {
    maxConcurrent: 8,
    minDelayMs: 100,
  },
});
```

## Behavior

- Prevents API abuse and bans
- Smooths bursts via minimal delay
- Integrates with retries/backoff

## Tips

- Use conservative limits when multithreading
- Prefer batching Reads over Writes
